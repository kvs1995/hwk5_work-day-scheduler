## User Story:
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively. 

My application was built with the following functionality:
```md
1) When opening the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. 
2) When scrolling down, the user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. 
3) When viewing the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. 
4) When a user clicks into a time block, an event can be entered. 
5) When the save button is selected for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage. 
6) When the page refreshed, then the saved event persists. 
```
